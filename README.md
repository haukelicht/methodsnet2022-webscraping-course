# Materials for the MethodsNET SSSRM course *Collecting Web Data with R*

This repository contains the materials of the course "Collecting Web Data with R"" taught by Hauke Licht at the *2022 Summer School in Social Research Methods* from 27 June to  1 July 2022 at Radbound University, Nijmegen, Netherlands.

## Course summary

The increasing availability of large amounts of online data enables new types of research in the social sciences. 
Over the past years, a variety of data --- whether election results, press releases, parliamentary speeches or social media content --- has become available online. 
Although these data has become easier to find, its extraction and reshaping into formats ready for downstream analyses can be challenging. 
This makes web data collection and cleaning skills essential for researchers.

**The goal of this course is to equip participants with the R programming skills necessary to gather online data and process them into formats they can use in their research.**

To get the most of the course, participants should have some prior experience with R and be willing to engage with different web technologies.

Participants will learn 

- about the characteristics of web data;
- how to extract via Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs), inlcuding those maintained by popular social media platforms such as Twitter;
- how to scrape content from different types of webpages; as well as
- important techniques for cleaning and reshaping web and social media data for downstream analysis.

## Course details

### Instructor

**Hauke Licht** is a post-doctoral researcher at the Cologne Center for Comparative Politics, University of Cologne, and has received his PhD from the University of Zurich. 
He develops and applies text-as-data methods to study political competition and democratic representation with a strong focus on cross-lingual applications.
In this research, he frequently relies on collecting textual data at scale by applying different web scraping techniques.
